I'm in the process of transitioning this portfolio into a more traditional MERN stack, as well as Typescripting it and adding SASS, among other things. This will be an almost complete overhaul, making it more pragmatic and DRYing it up a bunch. Overall just updating it to reflect my current skill level, as I was a junior developer when I made the original. The github is public if you want to keep track of my progress!
