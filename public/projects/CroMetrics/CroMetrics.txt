Cro Metrics is a 100% remote marketing agency that offers CRO, Paid, and Lifecycle marketing solutions to businesses estimated at $10-15M in annual revenue. My role at Cro was as an Experiment Engineer and Full Stack Engineer, and my primary responsibilities dealt with developing and maintaining experiment code and implementing experiment-driven redesigns to full-stack applications and websites. I also did a lot of internal development in full-stack and local hosting solutions for the engineering team and employee-facing applications.
