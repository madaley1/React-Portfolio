The KenpoNet is a website I found when researching the Martial Art I currently hold a black belt in. When I found it (and as of writing) it seems to have been abandoned, having not been updated in a few years, but recieving consistent updates before that. I decided to redesign & relaunch it after being unable to make contact with the owner via all available methods, and getting the contact information from the web host directly. Myself and a couple friends are creating a drupal site to host this information, and will be launching it upon completion and another round of attempts to contact the original owner, in case they have intent to continue work on their site.
