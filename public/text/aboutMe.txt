Hi! My name is Morgan, and I am a Full Stack Engineer. Most recently I worked with Cro Metrics as an Experiment Engineer. My position included doing experimentation via Optimizely, Convert, VWO, and other platforms, however I also did a lot of internal full-stack engineering for client dashboards, employee accounts, and Redesigns powered by years of experiment data to ensure that the redesign doesn't just act as a new coat of paint, but as a new roaring engine of the companies converstions. My time as a Drupal & Full Stack Developer at ASU's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences is what enabled me to do this work, and I appreciate all the experience that allows me to do this work.
